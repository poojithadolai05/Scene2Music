# 🎶 Scene2Music

**AI-Powered Prompt-Based Music Generation**  
Convert natural language descriptions of scenes into expressive music through a dual-stage deep learning pipeline.

## 🧠 Overview

**Scene2Music** is a deep learning framework that transforms **free-form textual scene descriptions** into **musical compositions**.  
Our architecture leverages large language models and symbolic music generation to bridge the gap between language and sound.

| Stage | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **1** | 🎯 **T5-Large (Fine-tuned)** | Converts a scene prompt into a structured musical caption |
| **2** | 🎼 **Text2MIDI** | Converts the caption into a symbolic MIDI sequence |
| **3** | 🔊 **FluidSynth** | Renders MIDI to playable audio |

## 📊 Datasets Used

### Custom Dataset: `scene_caption_pairs.json`

A curated dataset of 7000+ scene-caption pairs used to train the T5-large model to generate musical captions from scene descriptions.

- **Structure**: Each entry includes a natural scene and a corresponding rich musical caption.
- **Creation**:
  1. Captions sourced from MIDIcaps dataset.
  2. Matching scene descriptions generated using ChatGPT.
  3. Paired and saved in JSON format.

### Example

```json
{
  "scene": "A motivational startup launch video showcasing innovation and teamwork.",
  "caption": "This electronic song, infused with pop elements, exudes a joyful and motivational atmosphere... tempo of 130 bpm, in the key of A minor."
}
```

## 💡 Example

**Prompt:**  
> “A calm sunset over the ocean with gentle waves”

**Generated Caption:**  
> “A relaxing and meditative ambient song featuring piano, soft strings, and oceanic textures in C major at 80 BPM.”

### Generated Outputs:
- [Download .mid file](audio/generated.mid)
- [Download .wav file](audio/generated.wav)
- [Download .mp3 file](audio/generated.mp3)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔹 Stage 1: Scene → Musical Caption
Run `notebooks/T5_Large_TrainedModel_Scene2Caption.ipynb` to:

- Load or fine-tune the T5-Large model
- Generate musical descriptions for scene prompts

### 🔹 Stage 2: Caption → MIDI
Run `notebooks/Scene2Music.ipynb` to:

- Use Text2MIDI for caption-to-MIDI generation
- Render MIDI using FluidSynth
- Export `.mp3` using pydub

## 📈 Results

| Metric            | Result                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Caption Relevance |  High semantic alignment with prompt    |
| MIDI Coherence    |  Structured, rhythmically sound         |
| Audio Realism     |  Good with proper SoundFont             |
| Prompt Control    |  Strong interpretability and mood consistency |

## 📌 Highlights
🔹 Fine-tuned T5-Large on handcrafted scene–caption dataset
